        Entrepreneurship is a journey often characterized by uncertainty, challenges, and moments of self-doubt. Resilience—the ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep moving forward—is a cornerstone of entrepreneurial success.

        Many successful startups faced significant obstacles in their early days. For instance, Airbnb struggled to find investors, and its founders resorted to selling cereal boxes to stay afloat. Similarly, PayPal had to pivot its business model multiple times before finding success. These stories show that resilience is not just about enduring failure but learning from it, adapting strategies, and staying committed to the vision.
